## Getting Started

Welcome! Follow the instructions below to learn how to deploy, update and supercharge your documentation with Mintlify. Whether you're a developer or someone with no coding experience, we've designed Mintlify to work for you.

<Note>
  If you're not technical or don't have coding experience, we highly recommend using the Web Editor. It provides a visual interface that makes creating documentation simple without needing to write code.
</Note>

### Setting Up Your Documentation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web Editor (No Coding Required)">
    Our Web Editor provides a visual way to create and edit documentation without writing code or using command-line tools.

    ### What is the Web Editor?
    
    The Web Editor is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface that lets you create content just like you would in a document editor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. You can see exactly how your documentation will look as you create it.

    ### Creating Your First Documentation Project
    
    <Note>
      Mintlify uses GitHub to store and manage your documentation. If you don't have a GitHub account yet, you'll need to [create one](https://github.com/signup) before proceeding. It's free and only takes a minute to set up.
    </Note>
    
    1. Sign up or log in to your [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and go through the onboarding process.
       - In the last step of onboarding, If you're using the web editor don't worry about cloning a repo! Just click "Go to dashboard" when you see it, and Mintlify will handle the technical details for you.
    2. Click "Editor" to open the Web Editor and access your files, where you can start creating and editing your documentation
    
    ## Using the Web Editor

    The Web Editor makes it easy to create and manage your documentation without writing code.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion icon="slash-forward" title="Creating content">
        The Web Editor makes content creation simple with slash commands:
        
        1. Type `/` anywhere to open the command menu with many options:
           - Basic blocks (text, headings, lists, tables)
           - Media (images, embeds)
           - Callouts (info, note, warning, tip)
           - Components (accordions, cards, tabs)

        [See all available slash commands →](https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor#editing-content)
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion icon="pencil" title="Editor modes">
        The editor offers [three different modes](https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor#editor-modes) to work with your content:

          ![Slash Commands in Web Editor](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/mode-toggle-dark.png)
        </Frame>
        
        - **Visual Editor**: WYSIWYG editing experience (recommended for most users)
        - **Source Editor**: Edit the MDX code directly (recommended for developers)
        - **Diff View**: See what changes you've made before publishing
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Understanding Git concepts">
        Even though you're using a visual editor, Mintlify uses Git behind the scenes to track changes. Here's what you need to know:
        
        - **Repository**: A central location where all your documentation files are stored and tracked. Think of it like a special folder that remembers all changes made to its contents. It can be on a service like GitHub (remote) or on your computer (local).
        - **Branches**: Think of branches as separate versions of your documentation that exist in parallel. Like creating a copy of your work where you can make changes without affecting the original. The main branch is what your users see live on your site.
        <Warning>
          When working in the Web Editor, always check which branch you're on before publishing changes. If you're on the main branch (as shown in the top left), any changes you publish will immediately go live on your documentation site. If you want to make changes without affecting the live site, create a new branch first.
        </Warning>

        - **Commits**: When you save changes, you're creating a "commit" - a snapshot of your work at that moment with a message explaining what you changed. It's like taking a photo of your document at different stages of editing.

        - **Pull Requests**: A way to propose changes from one branch to another. It's like saying "I've made these edits in my draft version, can someone review them before we update the official version?"  
        
        <Note>
          The Web Editor handles these technical details for you, but understanding these concepts helps you collaborate with your team.
        </Note>
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion icon="cloud-arrow-up" title="Publishing your changes">
        To publish your changes:
        
        1. Make your edits in the Web Editor
        2. Click the "Publish" or "Publish Pull Request" button in the top right
        3. If you're on the main branch, changes will go live immediately
        4. If you're on another branch, you'll create a pull request for review
        
        <Warning>
          When working in the Web Editor, always check which branch you're on before publishing changes. If you're on the main branch (as shown in the top left), any changes you publish will immediately go live on your documentation site. It's good practice to make changes on a different branch instead of main and make a pull request so your team can review your changes before they go live.
          
          To create a new branch:
          1. Click on "main" in the top left corner
          2. Click "New branch"
          3. Enter a name for your branch
          4. Select "Bring my changes to [your branch name]"
          5. All your current changes will be migrated to the new branch

## Updating the Content

Mintlify enables you to easily customize the style, structure, and content of your docs.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Editing locally (recommended for developers)">
    1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
    2. Once git is installed, clone your docs repository using `git clone <your-repo>`. If you haven't set it up yet, now would be a good time to do so with these [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
    3. Use your favorite IDE to open the repository.
    4. Install our Mintlify CLI to preview changes with `npm i -g mintlify`.

    Learn more about this in our [local development guide](/development).

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Generating API references">
    You can easily set up your API references using an OpenAPI document.

    1. Add your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json` file into your docs repository or define the `openapi` field in `docs.json` with a URL.

    ```json
    "openapi": "link-to-your-openapi-file"
    ```

    2. Use our [scraper](/api-playground/openapi/setup#autogenerate-files-recommended) to autogenerate your OpenAPI endpoints files as:

    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url-to-openapi-file>
    ```

    3. Finally, include the generated endpoint MDX files to your `docs.json` under `navigation`.

    For a complete guide on using Mintlify with OpenAPI, check out [this guide](/api-playground/openapi/setup). [This guide](/api-playground/openapi/writing-openapi) explains how to configure your API authentication methods. For manual API references definition, explore [our syntax](/api-playground/overview).
