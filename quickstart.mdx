## Getting Started

Welcome! Follow the instructions below to learn how to deploy, update and supercharge your documentation with Mintlify. 
Whether you're a developer or someone with no coding experience, we've designed Mintlify to work for you.

### Setting Up Your Documentation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Web Editor (No Coding Required)">
    Our Web Editor provides a visual way to create and edit documentation without writing code or using command-line tools.

    ### What is the Web Editor?
    
    The Web Editor is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface that lets you create content just like you would in a document editor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word. You can see exactly how your documentation will look as you create it.

    ### Creating Your First Documentation Project
    
    1. Sign up or log in to your [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
    2. Click "Create New Project" or select an existing one
    3. Choose a name for your documentation
    4. Click "Editor" to open the Web Editor
    
    ### Creating Content
    
    The Web Editor makes it easy to add content using [slash commands](https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor#slash-commands):
    
    1. Type `/` anywhere to open the command menu
    2. Choose from various content types:
       - Text blocks (paragraphs, headings, lists, tables)
       - Media (images, videos)
       - Mintlify components (callouts, accordions, cards, tabs)
    
    The editor offers [three different modes](https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor#editor-modes) to work with your content:
    
    <Frame>
      ![Slash Commands in Web Editor](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/editor/mode-toggle-dark.png)
    </Frame>
    
    - **Visual Editor**: WYSIWYG editing experience (recommended for most users)
    - **Source Editor**: Edit the MDX code directly
    - **Diff View**: See what changes you've made before publishing
    
    [Learn more about editing content in the Web Editor →](https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor#editing-content)
    
    ### Understanding Git Concepts (Made Simple)
    
    Even though you're using a visual editor, Mintlify uses Git behind the scenes to track changes. Here's what you need to know:
    
   - **Repository**: A central location where all your documentation files are stored and tracked. Think of it like a special folder that remembers all changes made to its contents. It can be on a service like GitHub (remote) or on your computer (local).
    - **Branches**: Think of branches as separate versions of your documentation that exist in parallel. Like creating a copy of your work where you can make changes without affecting the original. The main branch is what your users see live on your site.
        <Warning>
          When working in the Web Editor, always check which branch you're on before publishing changes. If you're on the main branch (as shown in the top left), any changes you publish will immediately go live on your documentation site. If you want to make changes without affecting the live site, create a new branch first.
        </Warning>

    - **Commits**: When you save changes, you're creating a "commit" - a snapshot of your work at that moment with a message explaining what you changed. It's like taking a photo of your document at different stages of editing.

    - **Pull Requests**: A way to propose changes from one branch to another. It's like saying "I've made these edits in my draft version, can someone review them before we update the official version?"  
    
    <Note>
      The Web Editor handles these technical details for you, but understanding these concepts helps you collaborate with your team.
    </Note>
    
    ### Publishing Your Changes
    
    To publish your changes:
    
    1. Make your edits in the Web Editor
    2. Click the "Publish" button in the top right
    3. If you're on the main branch, changes will go live immediately
    4. If you're on another branch, you'll create a pull request for review
    
    [Learn more about making updates in the Web Editor →](https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor#making-updates)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Code-Based (For Developers)">
    If you prefer working with code and are comfortable with Git, you can use our code-based workflow.

    ### Setting Up Your Documentation Project
    
    1. Install our [GitHub app](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings) or connect your GitLab account to ensure your updates are automatically deployed

       ```
       
    6. Preview your documentation at http://localhost:3000
    
    ### Making Changes
    
    1. Edit your documentation files using any code editor
    2. Preview changes in your browser at http://localhost:3000
    3. Commit and push your changes to deploy automatically:
       ```bash
       git add .
       git commit -m "Update documentation"
       git push
       ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    description: "Brief description"
    ---

    Your content here...
    ```

## Working with Git in the Web Editor

The Web Editor makes it easy to use Git without knowing all the technical details. Learn more about [Git basics and workflows](https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor#git-basics) in the Web Editor documentation.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Creating and switching branches">
    Branches let you work on changes without affecting your live documentation.
    
    1. Click the branch name in the top left of the Web Editor
    2. Select an existing branch or click "New Branch"
    3. Give your branch a name (like "update-homepage" or "add-api-docs")
    
    <Frame>
      ![Branch Selection in Web Editor](/images/branch-selection.png)
    </Frame>
    
    **Tip for non-technical users:** Think of branches like creating a draft version of your documentation. Your main branch is what users see, while other branches are works in progress.
    
    [Learn more about creating branches →](https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor#1-creating-new-branches)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-commit" title="Making commits">
    Commits save your changes to the repository.
    
    1. Make your changes in the Web Editor
    2. Click "Publish" in the top right
    3. Add a commit message describing what you changed
    
    **Tip for non-technical users:** A commit is like saving a new version of your document with a note about what you changed.
    
    [Learn more about making commits →](https://mintlify.com/docs/web-editor#2-making-a-commit)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-pull-request" title="Creating pull requests">
    Pull requests let you propose changes and get feedback before publishing.
    
    1. Make changes on a branch other than main
    2. Click "Publish" to commit your changes
    3. Click "Create Pull Request"
    4. Add a title and description for your changes
    
    **Tip for non-technical users:** A pull request is like asking a colleague to review your draft before publishing it.

## Adding API Documentation

If your product includes APIs, Mintlify makes it easy to document them.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using OpenAPI">
    Generate API documentation automatically from your OpenAPI specification.

    <Note>
      **What is OpenAPI?** OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) is a standard format for describing REST APIs. It's a structured file that defines your API's endpoints, parameters, and responses.
    </Note>

    ### Steps to Add OpenAPI Documentation

    1. Add your OpenAPI file to your documentation:
       - **Web Editor:** Upload your OpenAPI file in the settings
       - **Code-Based:** Add the file to your repository or specify a URL in `docs.json`
    
    2. Generate API reference pages:
       ```bash
       npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url-to-openapi-file>
       ```

    3. Add the generated files to your navigation

    [Complete OpenAPI guide →](/api-playground/openapi/setup)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual API Documentation">
    If you don't have an OpenAPI specification, you can create API documentation manually.

    1. Create new pages for each API endpoint
    2. Use Mintlify's API components to document requests, responses, and parameters
    3. Add interactive examples with the API Playground

    [Manual API documentation guide →](/api-playground/overview)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
